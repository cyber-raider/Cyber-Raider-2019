### Challenge 4 - Captured
After all of this poking around the admins decided something fishy must be going
on on the network (also Bob has been notorious for allowing data to be
stolen...).  To get to the bottom of things they have decided to setup
packet captures for certain protected networks.

Take a look at the provided `doomed.pcap` file.  This may take some trial and error
(and probably some google-fu).  See what data was taken from Bob's system, and if
you can, recover any flags that were lost.

You can download `doomed.pcap` with the following command:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyber-raider/Cyber-Raider-2019/master/Challenge4/doomed.pcap
``` 

###### Helpful commands
`tshark, tcpdump, strings, grep`
